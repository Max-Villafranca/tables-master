# tables-master
Helps you learn and practice the multiplication tables.

Latest deployment [here](https://max-villafranca.github.io/tables-master/)

This is my first "serious", "complete", project.
My objective is to create a medium complexity (to me) website, that tests
my patience, commitment and perseverance, while I learn foundational JS concepts
as well as general programming skills for production deployment, while coding
in a clean, organized and professional manner.

## Features
- It has a selection menu with a cool interactive table.
- It will run a practice session based on the multiplications and settings selected.
- This is still version 0, but it's almost ready for version 1.

## To Do (to release V1):
- Add event listener on modal to allow canceling it with escape and when clicking on gray area.
- Add helping hand on practice session. (currently only indicates if answered correct or wrong)
- Improve results visuals, it looks too plain as it is.
